## About
I'm a 15 year old nerd with a large interest in electrical engineering and computer science. I'm particularly interested in systems software such as compilers and operating systems. I'm currently working on a compiler for my own programming language called "Grime". The Grime language focuses on providing an easily readable syntax similar to that of languages such as "Swift" and "Kotlin" whilst still trying to be suitable for doing low-level operations required for writing systems software such as direct memory management. More information about "Grime" can be found [here](/grime-docs).
